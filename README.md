Gauntlet port for the Colour Maximite 2
(I RECOMMEND YOU USE THE LAST BETA FIRMWARE FOR CMM2)

This is a version of Gauntlet to Colour Maximite 2.
I don´t own any rights about Gauntlet trademark, this is only a homebrew project made by me in my free time, and for sure in the current state, it has lots of bugs.
Keep in mind I´m only a Gauntlet fan with some basic developing skills and my target is only to challenge myself to port it to CMM2, it´s not a project with profit intentions.

Changelog:

v0.3a - 2020-05-06
- Made for the first CMM2 Gauntlet video on my Youtube channel.
- Some little optimizations

v0.1a - 2020-04-20
- Initial port from CMM1 to CMM2 - very unoptimized
- One player only.
- Only keyboard.
- Credits not working on the options menu.
- Many credits for the music are absent yet.
- Severe slow down when the screen is full of enemies.
- When demons have a shoot the player´s weapon can disappear for a moment (this is because they share the same code).
